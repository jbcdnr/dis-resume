\section{Inverted Files}
In order to speed up search of term occurrences, use indexing $\rightarrow$ \emph{Inverted files} is most widely used mechanism. It is appropriate when the text collection is \emph{semi-static}.

For a term $k$, \textbf{inverted list} $l_k = \langle f_k : d_{i_1}, ..., d_{i_{f_k}} \rangle$,

where $f_k$ is the $n^\circ$ of docs in which $k$ occurs, $d_{i_1}, ..., d_{i_{f_k}}$ is the list of identifiers of docs containing $k$.

\textbf{Inverted file} $IF = \langle i, k_i, l_{k_i}, i = 1,..., m \rangle$,

lexicographically ordered seq of inverted lists
